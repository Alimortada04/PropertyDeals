You're polishing the Marketing Center modal inside the PropertyDeals Seller Dashboard. Currently, at zoom levels above 100% (e.g. 125%, 150%), content overflows or gets cut off, and scroll behavior becomes unreliable.

‚úÖ Objective
Ensure all modal content stays visible and scrolls properly at all zoom levels.

üîß Required Fixes
Enable Scrollable Modal Content

Ensure all modal pages (New Campaign, JV Partners, etc.) use a consistent internal scroll structure:

tsx
Copy
Edit
<div className="fixed max-w-[800px] w-full h-[90vh] rounded-2xl shadow-xl bg-white overflow-hidden flex flex-col">
  <div className="px-6 pt-5 pb-2 border-b"> {/* Header */} </div>
  <div className="overflow-y-auto px-6 py-4 flex-1"> {/* Scrollable Content */} </div>
  <div className="border-t px-6 py-4"> {/* Footer Buttons */} </div>
</div>
Fix Zoom-Level Overflows

Avoid fixed pixel heights for content boxes inside the modal.

Use flex-1 with overflow-y-auto instead of manually setting height on children.

Apply min-h-0 on any flex parents that contain scrollable children to avoid layout breakage.

Responsive Padding

Use responsive padding classes like px-4 sm:px-6 md:px-8 to ensure proper spacing at all screen widths and zoom levels.

Ensure buttons don‚Äôt get squished or wrapped when zoomed in.

Sticky Footer for Actions

Keep launch buttons (Launch Campaign, Send Invite) pinned to the bottom of the modal using sticky bottom-0 or placing them in a persistent footer slot.

Test at 75%, 100%, 125%, and 150% Zoom

All modal steps should remain:

Scrollable internally

Vertically centered

Fully visible

Buttons always accessible

üßæ Apply to These Modal Sections:
New Campaign (All steps, especially Step 4: Final Details)

All Campaigns tabbed view

JV Partners modal

Initial 3-card view ("New Campaign", "All Campaigns", "JV Partners")

üñºÔ∏è Design Guidance
Font: Lato and League Spartan

Color palette and padding should remain consistent with the platform

Maintain soft corner radius (rounded-2xl) and light shadow (shadow-xl)
