inalize Tab Layout & Functionality for Seller Property Editor
Target File
pages/sellerdash/[userid]/property/[propertyid].tsx

🧭 Objective
Redesign and finalize the property editor page for sellers so it mirrors the step-by-step listing modal in full fidelity—preserving style, section layout, and field logic. The new structure should use four main tabs:

✅ Tabs to Implement
1. Property Details
⚙️ Source: Use Step 1 of the property listing modal.

📐 Design: Must exactly match listing modal design.

🧠 Functionality:

Editable fields with same validations.

All fields connected to Supabase via property_profile.

Includes:

Property Title

Property Type

Address, City, State, ZIP

County, Parcel ID

Bedrooms, Bathrooms, Year Built

Square Footage, Lot Size

Parking

✍️ Also include: AI Description + Additional Notes (from Step 5 and Step 4 of modal).

💾 Fields must be editable and sync changes using supabase.from("property_profile").update(...).eq("id", propertyid).

2. Media
⚙️ Source: Use Step 2 of the property listing modal.

📐 Design: Copy all media field styling and upload UX exactly.

🧠 Functionality:

Show primary image (thumbnail) and allow upload/removal.

Show gallery images (multiple), allow reordering and removal.

Video options:

Tab switcher for video link vs file upload.

Show thumbnail/file name if present.

✅ All uploads use uploadFileToSupabase() and save back to the property_profile table.

3. Finances
⚙️ Source: Use Step 3 of the listing modal.

📐 Design: Match styling exactly—ARV, rents, unit breakdown, expenses, repair section.

🧠 Functionality:

Dynamic add/remove rows for expenses and units.

Monthly/annual repair cost calculation.

Add repair file quote uploads via the existing logic.

🔁 Sync changes to:

arv, rent_unit, expense_items, repair_projects, expenses_total_monthly, repair_costs_total (snake_case in Supabase).

4. Logistics
⚙️ Source: Use Step 4 of listing modal.

📐 Design: Reuse modal’s “Deal Terms,” “Comps,” “Documentation,” and “Partners & Notes”.

🧠 Functionality:

Purchase Price, Listing Price, Assignment Fee (auto-calculated)

Access Type (dropdown), Closing Date (calendar)

Comps: array of strings (manually add/remove)

Upload Purchase Agreement + Assignment Agreement

Add/remove partners dynamically

🔁 Sync fields like:

purchase_price, listing_price, assignment_fee, access_type, closing_date, comps, purchase_agreement, assignment_agreement, jv_partners.
