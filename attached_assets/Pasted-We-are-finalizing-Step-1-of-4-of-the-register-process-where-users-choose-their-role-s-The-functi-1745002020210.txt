We are finalizing Step 1 of 4 of the /register process, where users choose their role(s). The functionality and visuals are close but need to be refined for both UX clarity and visual integrity.

✅ Required Fixes
🔧 1. Fix Continue Button Logic
✅ Must only enable “Continue” when at least one role is selected

❌ Currently not working even when valid selection is made

Logic:

ts
Copy
Edit
if (selectedRoles.length === 0) {
  disable Continue
} else {
  enable Continue
}
Style “Continue” button disabled state:

tailwind

Edit
bg-gray-200 text-gray-400 cursor-not-allowed
🎨 2. Fix Background Color Logic for Multiple Roles
When only ONE role is selected:
✅ Keep existing soft white + tinted hue background


Role	Gradient Tint
Buyer	White → #09261E (dark green) soft wash
Seller	White → #135341 (light green) soft wash
REP	White → #803344 (wine) soft wash
When MULTIPLE roles are selected:
🔁 Instead of using full dark fills or overlays, add colored washes in sections of the background — like how the homepage handles visual segmentation.

🧠 Design Direction:

Think of it like adding colored spotlight washes from the sides:

2 roles selected → split 50/50

3 roles selected → soft zones blended across left/center/right

Recommended Implementation:

Use multiple radial-gradient or linear-gradient backgrounds with color stop percentages

Keep main background light, but introduce gentle tinted overlays

css
Copy
Edit
background: radial-gradient(at 25% 50%, #09261E10 30%, transparent 60%),
            radial-gradient(at 75% 50%, #80334410 30%, transparent 60%),
            #F5F5F5;
Maintain a clean, breathable look — not harsh or overwhelming

🃏 3. Floating Cards Should Match Role Selection
Rules:
If 1 role selected, show 4 floating feature cards for that role

If 2 roles selected, show 8 cards (4 per role)

If 3 roles selected, show 12 total cards (4 per role)

Behavior:
Each card floats as it does now — subtle hover motion

Ensure cards do not overlap — arrange in a 2x2, 3x4, or grid layout with:

tailwind
Copy
Edit
gap-6 flex-wrap justify-center
Use staggered animation or transition on role toggle

Example: REP + Buyer = show 4 REP cards + 4 Buyer cards, spread evenly across both sides of the main panel.

✅ 4. Top Tag Update
Change the label at the top to reflect multiple selections:

text
Copy
Edit
• Made for Buyers •
• Made for Sellers •
• Made for REPs •
If 2 or 3 are selected:

text
Copy
Edit
• Multiple Roles Selected •
Add animation or cycle through selected tags (like the signin page does).
