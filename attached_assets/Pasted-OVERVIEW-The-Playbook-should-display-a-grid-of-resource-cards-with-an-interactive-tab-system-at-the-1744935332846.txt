OVERVIEW
The Playbook should display a grid of resource cards, with an interactive tab system at the top that filters which cards are visible based on the audience:

css
Copy
Edit
[ All ] [ Buyers ] [ Sellers ] [ REPs ]
There are no separate pages or folders — everything lives on /playbook and dynamically filters based on the tab selected.

📚 TABS & CARD FILTER LOGIC
Each tab displays a filtered view of resource cards:


Resource	Tabs to Appear Under
PropertyDictionary	All
Due Diligence Checklist	All
Investment Strategies	All
Video Tutorials	All
Creative Financing Guide	Buyers, REPs
Disposition & Buyer Building Playbook	Sellers, REPs
How to Walk a Property Guide	Sellers, REPs
Ethics & Compliance Center	Sellers, REPs
Live Deal Anatomy / Case Studies	All (placeholder card only)
Each card should include metadata so it can be filtered based on audience tags like:

ts
Copy
Edit
audience: ["buyers", "reps"]
🧱 CARD COMPONENT DESIGN
Build a reusable PlaybookCard.tsx component styled like a modern educational platform (library-style):

Design:
Icon or illustration at the top in a soft circle (bg-[#E9F5F0])

Bold title (e.g. “Creative Financing Guide”)

1-line description

CTA Button: “View Resource”

Style: bg-[#09261E] text-white hover:bg-[#135341] rounded px-4 py-2 text-sm

Optional: Badge like “Coming Soon” for placeholder cards

Interactivity:
Hover: hover:scale-105 hover:shadow-md transition-all

Card layout: rounded corners, subtle border, spacing (p-4 or p-6)

Responsive Grid:
4 columns on desktop

2 on tablet

1 column stacked on mobile (grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4)

🧭 TAB BEHAVIOR
Use React state or URL fragment (#buyers, #reps, etc.) to track tab

Clicking a tab should dynamically filter the visible resource cards

Highlight active tab with border-b-2 border-[#09261E] text-[#09261E]

Optional:
Add a small search bar above the grid to filter by keyword

🏗️ COMPONENTS TO BUILD
/playbook/index.tsx

PlaybookCard.tsx (reusable component)

TabNav.tsx or internal tab filter logic

Basic data structure for resource cards (can be static or pulled from Supabase)

🔒 TECH CONSIDERATIONS
“Live Deal Anatomy” should be a placeholder only — no link, and show a “Coming Soon” badge

Use TailwindCSS for all styling

Use fallback icons or images if a card has no assigned visual

Make sure cards gracefully collapse into mobile view

🧠 OPTIONAL UX ENHANCEMENTS
Animate card entries (fade-in, slide-up)

Show tooltip or hover text on cards for more info

Include subtle Updated X days ago or “🔥 Trending” labels on popular cards

Add icons for the tabs (e.g. 👤 for REPs, 🏠 for Sellers)
