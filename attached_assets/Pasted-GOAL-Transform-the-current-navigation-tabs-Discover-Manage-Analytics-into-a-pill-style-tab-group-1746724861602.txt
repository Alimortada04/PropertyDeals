GOAL
Transform the current navigation tabs (Discover, Manage, Analytics) into a pill-style tab group that is:

Visually distinct

Sleek and minimal

Easily scannable

Responsive across screen sizes

✅ DESIGN & STRUCTURE INSTRUCTIONS
🔹 1. Layout
Wrap the tabs in a single container styled as a soft, elevated pill group:

css
Copy
Edit
bg-white border border-neutral-200 rounded-full px-2 py-1 shadow-md
Center the group horizontally, and place it with margin above the dashboard content

🔹 2. Tab Design
Each tab (Discover, Manage, Analytics) should:

Be styled as a pill with:

px-5 py-2 rounded-full transition-all

Slight animation on hover and click

Active Tab:

Background: dark green (#09261E)

Text: white

Inactive Tabs:

Border only (border-neutral-300)

Text: dark gray (#333)

Hover: soft green background (#E6F3EC)

🔹 3. Icon Support (Optional but Recommended)
Include subtle line-style icons next to tab text:

Discover → magnifying glass (🔍)

Manage → clipboard/list (📋)

Analytics → chart bar (📊)

Icons should:

Be muted in style (stroke icon, 16–20px)

Align inline with the text, spacing via gap-2

🔹 4. Navigation Logic
Clicking a tab should:

Visually switch the active state

Route to the correct dashboard tab:

/dashboard?tab=discover

/dashboard?tab=manage

/dashboard?tab=analytics

Keep state synced with the active tab query parameter

🔹 5. Breadcrumb/Micro-copy Under Tabs (Optional)
Below the tab group, add a small contextual label:

text
Copy
Edit
You’re currently viewing: Discover
This helps orient the user without clutter

✅ INTERACTION & FEEDBACK
Tabs should have:

Smooth transition animations on click

Active underline (optional): a small green bar animates under the selected tab

Optional micro bounce or color pop on active selection

✅ RESPONSIVENESS
On smaller screens:

Tabs should collapse horizontally into a scrollable bar (overflow-x-auto)

Use flex-nowrap gap-2 for proper spacing

Ensure each tab is still clearly tappable

✅ SUMMARY
Final result should feel like a clean, segmented nav component with strong usability and subtle elevation. It should draw attention naturally while staying out of the way once a user is reading page content.
