1. 🎚️ Role Toggle Buttons
Add three pill-style toggle buttons, placed above or below the login card:

css
Copy
Edit
[ For Buyers ] [ For Sellers ] [ For REPs ]
Styling:
tailwind
Copy
Edit
px-4 py-1 rounded-full text-sm font-medium border transition
bg-white/70 hover:bg-white text-[#09261E] shadow-sm
Highlight selected tab with a filled or active state

Clicking a tab triggers an update to background + floating cards

Default to Buyers on first load

2. 🎨 Role-Based Background Colors
Use the following brand-aligned background gradients per role:


Role	Color / Gradient Suggestion
Buyers	bg-[#09261E] or from-[#09261E] to-[#0f3e2a]
Sellers	bg-[#135341] or from-[#135341] to-[#1e6d52]
REPs	bg-[#803344] or from-[#803344] to-[#a34d5e]
Use Tailwind classes or CSS gradients to implement — the transition between roles should animate smoothly.

3. 🧩 Floating Feature Cards (Update per Role)
Show floating benefit cards that change content per role selection. Cards should:

Be styled consistently:

tailwind
Copy
Edit
bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md px-4 py-3 w-[230px] text-sm border border-gray-100
Animate in/out on role change (opacity, translate, or framer-motion)

4. 🔄 Auto-Cycle Animation
Automatically rotate through the 3 roles every 6–7 seconds

If the user manually clicks a role, pause auto-rotation

Optionally use a setInterval + clearInterval logic in React state

💡 Optional Polish
Add slight blur or radial glow behind main login card

Use a subtle motion fade/scale transition when switching card sets

Use transition-colors or framer-motion for background change

📱 Responsive Behavior
On mobile:

Role buttons stack or scroll horizontally

Floating cards reduce to 1–2 and animate in behind the auth card

Login form always stays visible and top-priority
