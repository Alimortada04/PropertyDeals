Step 1: ROUTING + SIDEBAR UI FIXES
🧠 Prompt for Replit Agent:
Set /properties as the new homepage (/) by updating the root route to redirect to /properties on load.

In the sidebar:

Move the search icon up slightly so it’s not covered by the bottom bar.

Ensure the layout remains consistent across all screen sizes.

Maintain the logo pinned to top, menu icons centered, and search icon pinned slightly above the bottom.

🔧 Step 2: Build Account Preferences Flow (End-to-End)
Now let’s scope the user experience for editable account preferences, stored in Supabase, and shown on their public profile page.

🧩 User Flow Breakdown:
A. Logged-In User Account Page
/profile (or /profile/account)

Tabs: Account Info, Preferences, Connections, Notifications (as planned)

“Preferences” tab contains:

Preferred property types (e.g., Single Family, Multi-Family, Land, etc.)

Preferred conditions (e.g., Light Rehab, Heavy Rehab, Turnkey)

Markets interested in (multi-select city/state)

Budget range ($min – $max)

Financing type(s) (Cash, Hard Money, Conventional, Creative)

Closing speed (dropdown: ASAP, 7–14 days, 15–30 days, etc.)

Past deals done (numeric + optional upload proof field)

All values saved to the buyer_profiles table for now.

🛠️ Prompt for Replit Agent (Preferences Tab Connection)
Connect the Preferences tab on the /profile page to Supabase:

On page load, fetch the logged-in user's preferences from the buyer_profiles table.

Populate all form inputs with current values (multi-select, dropdowns, inputs).

On form submit, update the Supabase buyer_profiles record with the new data.

Use real-time form validation + a confirmation alert after saving.

All fields:

preferred_property_types (array of strings)

preferred_conditions (array of strings)

target_markets (array of strings)

budget_min (number)

budget_max (number)

financing_methods (array of strings)

closing_timeline (string)

past_deals (integer)

proof_of_funds (optional file upload to Supabase Storage)

B. Public Buyer Profile Page
/profile/[username] or /buyer/[username]

Display select fields from their preferences publicly:

Property types, markets, budget range, financing types, and deal history

Do not show sensitive details (e.g., email, phone, uploads)

🛠️ Prompt for Replit Agent (Public Profile Display)
On /profile/[username], fetch the buyer profile by username (or user_id) and display public preference data:

Property types

Target markets

Budget range

Financing types

Past deals completed

Only fetch and display non-sensitive fields from buyer_profiles.
