Engagement Page (/sellerdash/[userId]/engagement)

Top section(Overview):
Should be more built out and feel like its own review section of number of active properties, total views, saves, messages, and offers as well as average of each per property and improvement over time. Use design ideas from big CRM and management platforms to make this clean, intuitive, and animated.
Expand top stats to include:

Active Properties

Total Views, Saves, Messages, Offers

Averages per property

Time-based improvement indicators (e.g., “+12% in past 30 days”)

Use layout/styling ideas from top CRM dashboards (e.g., Salesforce, HubSpot):

Animated cards

Subtle shadow on hover

Icons + tooltips

Property List (Left Panel):
Each card should show:

Image

Address

Price

Four engagement metrics (Views, Saves, Messages, Offers)

If there's an unresponded message or offer, show a bold colored highlight (e.g., green or red) and clicking it should scroll the content panel to that section.
