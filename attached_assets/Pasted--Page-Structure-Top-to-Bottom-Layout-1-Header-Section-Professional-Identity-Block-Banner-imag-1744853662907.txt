🧠 UX & Design Guidelines
Visual Hierarchy: Flow from most important → supporting info

Use whitespace to separate sections clearly

Sticky elements: Only the nav should be sticky — avoid overlapping content

Tailwind for all styling – match the PropertyDeals design system (Lato, League Spartan, green/salmon/silver)

Smooth transitions: Use transition-all, duration-300, ease-in-out for modals, tabs, and animations
