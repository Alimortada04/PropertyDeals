🎯 Core Goals
Showcase our brand promise and identity clearly

Drive users toward browsing properties and connecting with REPs

Create a visually engaging, modern scrolling experience with movement and flair

Reflect community-driven energy through content and interactivity

📐 1. Layout & Structure
Above the Fold (Hero Section):

Bold headline + subheadline clearly articulating our purpose

Ex: “Find hidden deals. Connect directly. No middleman.”

Add 3 fast-hitting value prop icons:
✅ Off-Market Only | 🤝 Verified REPs | 📊 Deal-Ready Tools

Primary CTAs:

🟢 Browse Properties
🟣 Connect with REPs

Sticky Search/Nav Behavior:

Remove the current top-right banner on this page.

Let search filters live within a full-width navbar beneath the hero.

That navbar should be sticky like Redfin/Kaggle (acts as the main scroll anchor).

Ensure it spans full page width, not just content width (100vw with padding on both sides).

🧭 2. Modern UI/UX Enhancements
Sticky Sidebar Behavior:

Ensure no content is ever covered by the collapsed sidebar.

All content should start to the right of the collapsed bar — at all breakpoints.

Expanded sidebar should open over content, not push it.

Mobile Navigation Updates:

Remove the current floating hamburger.

Add new full-width top navbar with hamburger on left, logo next to it.

When opened, menu should slide in full-screen (like Kaggle mobile).

Clicking outside the menu should auto-close it.

Ensure full responsiveness and seamless transitions.

🧠 3. Visual & Interaction Polish
Homepage Flow Improvements:

Improve section hierarchy: increase spacing, font scaling, and reduce visual clutter.

Add dynamic transitions between homepage sections (not abrupt scroll jumps).

Keep layout clean but with depth, spacing, and a subtle card/grid structure.

Property Card Enhancements:

Card is fully clickable (not just "View Details" button).

Show main image + secondary image on hover or chevron carousel (hover or tap).

Top-right tag: Property Type (e.g. Single Family, Duplex…)

Top-left tag: Investment Type (e.g. Flip, Buy & Hold…)

Include REP avatars partially tucked behind View button — hover floats them up

Add views + favorites counters with clean icon badges

Parallax + Movement Enhancements:

Use parallax or scroll-based animations on hero section, section transitions, and illustrations.

Add micro-interactions (hover, slide-in, fade-in) to keep energy high.

Consider subtle background motion, animated SVGs, or floating elements that reinforce the brand identity.

Typography & Visual Identity:

Maintain brand fonts (League Spartan headers + Lato body)

Use our full color palette, including Salmon as hover or accent highlight

Avoid any off-brand colors like orange

💬 Community & Connection Focus
REP Room Callouts:

Showcase verified REPs in a carousel or feature block

“Trusted Real Estate Professionals ready to help you close deals faster.”

CTA: “Meet REPs in your area” → /reps

Discussions Sneak Peek:

Highlight recent threads from /discussions in a clean horizontal scroll

“What investors are talking about right now”

Stats / Trust Signals:

Include community stats:

💬 3,200+ active members | 🏘️ 2,100+ off-market properties | 🤝 900+ verified REPs
