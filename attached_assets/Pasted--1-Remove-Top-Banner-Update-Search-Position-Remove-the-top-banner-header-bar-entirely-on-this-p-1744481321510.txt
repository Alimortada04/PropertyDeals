📍 1. Remove Top Banner & Update Search Position
Remove the top banner/header bar entirely on this page.

Instead, place the search bar and filter controls directly at the top of the page, before any listings load.

Make the search section behave like a navbar:

Sticky at the top when scrolling

Full-width matching the edge of the viewport — it should not be constrained by page padding.

🧱 2. Property Card Redesign
Update the design of each property card in the listings grid to reflect the following:

✅ Entire Card Clickable

Clicking anywhere on the card should navigate to that individual property page.

🖼️ Images

Display a primary image.

On hover, show a secondary image as a smooth fade or side-swipe transition.

On hover (desktop):

Show left/right chevron arrows to scroll through additional images (if available).

Clicking arrows navigates the image slider.

🏷️ Property Tags

Top-right corner: colored tag for property type, such as:

Single Family, Duplex, Triplex, Multi Family, Condo, Townhouse, Land

Tag color should align with branding or vary based on property type.

🛏️ Property Info

Display:

🛏️ Beds

🛁 Baths

📏 Square Footage

💼 Investment Type(s): Flip, Buy & Hold, Seller Finance, etc.

Show these in a visually clean icon-row or quick stat bar.

👥 REP Avatars (Connected Professionals)

Bottom-right of each card (near the “View Details” area):

Show stacked small avatar circles of people connected to this property (e.g., wholesalers, contractors).

Only ~90% of each avatar should be visible unless hovered, at which point it rises slightly and becomes clickable.

Clicking an avatar opens the respective /rep/[name] profile page.

🔥 Engagement Metrics

Show view & favorite counts clearly on the card (bottom or side area):

👁️ Total Views

❤️ Favorited By X Users

📱 3. Mobile & UX Responsiveness
Ensure all new behaviors (image hover, sticky navbar, avatar hover) gracefully degrade on mobile or become tap-friendly.

Avatars can be tapped to raise them and expose profile link.
