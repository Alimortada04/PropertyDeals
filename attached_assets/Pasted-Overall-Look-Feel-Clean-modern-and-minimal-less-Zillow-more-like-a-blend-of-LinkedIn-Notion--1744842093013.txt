Overall Look & Feel
Clean, modern, and minimal — less Zillow, more like a blend of LinkedIn, Notion, and Apple’s UI.

Sleek cards with ample white space (or light gray backgrounds in dark mode), soft shadows, and rounded corners (e.g., rounded-2xl).

Use professional fonts: Lato for text, League Spartan Semi-Bold for headers (as you’ve been doing).

Stick to your brand palette — Dark Green (#09261E), Wine (#803344), and Silver (#D8D8D8) — but use colors sparingly for accents only (e.g., badge icons, links, CTAs).

Each card should feel like a profile snapshot, not a loud ad.

📇 Card Content Layout
Each REP Card should balance visual appeal with quick-glance value. Suggested layout:

Top Section
Profile Image / Logo – Circular or rounded square (optional placeholder if none)

Name – Bold, slightly larger than the rest

Profession Label – Agent, Wholesaler, Lender, Contractor, etc.

Verified Badge (if applicable) – Small checkmark icon for trust

Middle Section (Quick Info Block)
Split into 2–3 quick columns or rows:

🏠 Location: "Milwaukee, WI"

💼 Role/Company: “Founder, REI Solutions”

📞 Contact: Email or "Message REP" button

📊 Experience: “5+ Years” or “100+ Deals Closed”

⭐️ Rating or Review Count (if implemented): “★ 4.8 (26 reviews)”

Bottom Section (Optional Tags or CTA)
Display relevant Tags: e.g. Fix & Flip, Multifamily, Buy & Hold, Contractor – Licensed, Off-Market Deals, Bilingual

CTA Button: "View Profile", "Connect", or "Request Contact"

🧠 UX Best Practices
Hover interaction on desktop: slightly lifts the card and reveals more info (like mini bio or service specialties).

Filter/sort dropdown above the grid: Role, Location, Tags, Years of Experience, etc.

Responsive: Cards stack vertically on mobile but still feel premium.

Loading shimmer effect while cards load = adds polish.

🔐 Bonus Trust Layer
Small “last active” timestamp or “responds in X hours” badge (helps make it feel like a live network).

Option to feature “Verified REP” or “Top REP” (like Airbnb Superhost) to highlight active, high-quality users.
