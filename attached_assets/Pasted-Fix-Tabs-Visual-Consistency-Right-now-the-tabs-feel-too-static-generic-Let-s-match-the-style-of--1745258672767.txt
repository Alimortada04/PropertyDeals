Fix Tabs – Visual Consistency
Right now, the tabs feel too static/generic. Let’s match the style of REP filters you’ve used elsewhere (pill-style buttons with status-aware highlights).

New Design Spec:

Use rounded pill tabs

Background color change or underline on active

Font: League Spartan bold

Hover: subtle shadow or color shift

Suggested Tabs (Final Set):

🔍 Explore Deals

📂 My Deals

💬 Messages

🧰 Tools

📈 Analytics

🧠 Priority Buyer

🎮 2. Gamify Buyer Goals
Turn submitted criteria into motivation and movement:

Use Buyer’s Initial Setup Data:

“How many properties do you plan to buy this year?”

“What’s your monthly budget range?”

“What markets are you buying in?”

Display & Track:

🎯 “Goal: 4 properties in 2025” → 1/4 Acquired ✅

🧭 Market focus progress: “75% of saved deals in Milwaukee”

🔄 Investment type breakdown: Fix & Flip vs Buy & Hold

💡 Add dynamic nudges: “You’re behind pace — want help sourcing deals?”

📈 3. Analytics Tab
Let’s go beyond fluff — show real ROI data tied to their account:

Analytics Section Should Include:

📊 Deals Closed (Count, Location, Timeline)

💵 Average Purchase Price

💸 Projected vs Actual ROI

🤝 Team Members Used

Sellers, REPs, Contractors, TCs (clickable if they’re on PD platform)

⏱ Avg Deal Time from Interest → Close

This becomes an investor dashboard + memory bank over time.

🔧 4. More Utility
Every buyer should feel like the platform is working for them.

Ideas:
🔔 "Property Suggestions" button — generates listings based on activity

💬 “Need a REP in [city]?” quick-connect

✅ Save deal analysis notes per property

💰 ROI simulator overlay on each property card

🧪 5. Future AI Ideas (Plan for Integration)
Even if not implemented yet, design for this now:

“Show me cash-flowing duplexes in my price range”

“Estimate holding costs if I buy this property”

“Predict top-performing zip codes based on my criteria”

You can label these as “Powered by PD AI (Coming Soon)” — builds hype and keeps users hungry.
