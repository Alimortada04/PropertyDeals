Core Requirements:
Unified Entry Point

Route: /dashboard

Detect and auto-load the user’s activeRole (stored in user object).

Supported roles: 'buyer', 'seller', 'rep'

Role Switcher UI

A dropdown or tab element allowing the user to:

Switch between approved roles.

See verification status (Approved ✅, Pending ⚠️, Not Applied ❌).

Add new roles (if not already active).

Displayed in top-right corner or sidebar.

Role Status Handling

Each role has a status: approved, pending, denied, or not_applied

The dashboard switcher should reflect these statuses visually (icons, text, or badges).

Dynamic Dashboard Content

Based on the user’s activeRole, dynamically load one of:

Buyer Dashboard

Seller Dashboard

REP Dashboard

All dashboards should live under the /dashboard layout and share the same wrapper.

Onboarding Flow for New Roles

If a user clicks “Add Seller” or “Add REP,” show a modal or redirect to onboarding flow:

Seller: Basic info form → optional deal sample → team review

REP: Services offered → coverage area → license or portfolio → review

After submission, the role status = pending until manually approved.
