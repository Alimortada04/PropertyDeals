🛏️ 2. Crucial Property Highlights (icon bubbles)
Directly beneath the image or headline:

Display key metrics using bubbles or square icons:

🛏 Beds

🏗 Year Built

Use rounded square or circular backgrounds for a clean visual. Center them in a responsive grid.

📊 3. Secondary Property Info
List below the highlights:

Property Type

Lot Size

Parking

Price per Sqft

Condition (e.g. Full Gut, Turnkey, BRRR)

Make this section responsive and styled like quick tags or a definition list layout.

🪄 4. Expandable Accordion Sections (like Realtor.com)
Below the main content, add accordion sections with the following structure and content:

🧮 The Numbers
Includes:

Estimated Rent

Estimated Expenses

Estimated Repair Costs

ARV (After Repair Value)

Property Tax info

Include CTA at the bottom of this section:
🛠 "I'm a contractor — Submit a Quote" (leads to form or contractor submission area)

📈 Relevant Calculators (context-aware)
If investmentType = Flip, show Flip Calculator pre-filled with ARV, repair, cost.

If investmentType = Buy & Hold, show Rental Calculator with rent, taxes, expenses filled in.

These calculators already exist on other pages — embed those directly here and ensure the data flows from this property’s info.

🧑‍🔧 Find a REP
Suggest local professionals relevant to the type of deal:

Flip → Contractor, Hard Money Lender, Agent

Rental → Property Manager, Lender, Insurance

These should be buttons linking to filtered views of REPs in the REP Room.

🏛 History (API Data)
Display:

Public and MLS data (if integrated)

Purchase history with dates and prices

City/county appraised value by year

Tax amount by year

Use timeline format or table for clarity.

🏘️ Comps
Pull in and list comparable properties using an API (Zillow, MLS, PropStream-style integration if available).

Each comp should show:

Address, image

Price

Bed/Bath/Sqft

Distance from subject property

📱 Notes for UX & Responsiveness

Use brand color palette and font styling
