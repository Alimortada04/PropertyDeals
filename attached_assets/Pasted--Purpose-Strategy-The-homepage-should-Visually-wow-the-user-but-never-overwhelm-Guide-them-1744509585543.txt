🧠 Purpose & Strategy
The homepage should:

Visually wow the user — but never overwhelm.

Guide them intuitively to find deals, meet REPs, or join discussions.

Convey the power of the PropertyDeals platform through storytelling, immersive scroll behavior, and clean, modern UI.

Think bold storytelling meets minimalist UX — inspired by Jeton, Slite, Superlist, Moon Project, and Adobe’s best design examples.

🧭 Homepage Structure & Vision
1. Hero Section
Full screen impact.

Use subtle animation or video (optional parallax).

Big, bold value statement:

“Deals. Connections. A Real Estate Revolution.”
Subtext:
“Discover off-market properties. Meet verified REPs. Close faster.”

Primary CTA: “Start Exploring”

Secondary CTA: “See How It Works”

2. Live Deal Teasers
Horizontal scroll or carousel of 3 property cards (auto-rotate on desktop, swipeable on mobile).

Each card animates in, subtly.

Hover: switch images or show contact avatars (like Redfin).

3. REP Room Showcase
Horizontal scroll of REP avatars (tagged Agent, Contractor, etc.)

Caption: “Over 1,200 Real Estate Professionals ready to help.”

CTA: “Browse The REP Room”

4. Platform Benefits (3 Columns w/ Animation)
“Verified Professionals Only”

“Real-Time Deal Matching”

“Built-In Tools for Sellers, Investors & REPs”

Use icons or custom illustrations — animate them into view with scroll.

5. Immersive Scroll Block
Full-width background sections.

Each scroll step tells a short story:

“Need a deal? We got you.”

“Need a contractor? You’re covered.”

“Want to network? Join the conversation.”

Subtle scroll transitions, layered elements, and movement.

6. Community Highlight Feed (Optional)
Pull in 2–3 top posts from /discussions

Create a “Join the Conversation” CTA

7. CTA Footer Section
Emotionally-driven final CTA:

“PropertyDeals isn’t a platform. It’s your competitive edge.”

Primary Button: “Sign Up Free”
