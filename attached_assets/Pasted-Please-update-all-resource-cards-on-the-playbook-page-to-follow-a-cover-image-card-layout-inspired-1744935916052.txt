Please update all resource cards on the /playbook page to follow a cover-image card layout, inspired by modern learning libraries like Skool.com. This layout should make each resource feel like a visual module or “chapter” in the PropertyPlaybook.

✅ CARD STRUCTURE (TOP → BOTTOM)
🔹 1. Cover Image (Top 40%)
Use a cover image at the top of the card

Suggested size: w-full h-32 (or h-40 on large screens)

Styling:

object-cover rounded-t-xl
Fallback: If no specific image is available, show a branded illustration or category icon

🔹 2. Card Body (Bottom 60%)
Title: bold and clear (e.g. text-lg font-semibold text-[#09261E])

Subtitle or Description: max 1–2 lines (e.g. text-sm text-gray-600)

🔁 INTEGRATION NOTES
This layout should work with the new tabbed Playbook layout you’re building (where users can filter cards by audience).

Each card can pull from a central card list with:

ts
Copy
Edit
{
  title: string;
  description: string;
  image: string;
  audience: string[];
  route: string;
  comingSoon?: boolean;
}
If a card is comingSoon, do not link it — instead, show a disabled CTA and a “Coming Soon” badge.
