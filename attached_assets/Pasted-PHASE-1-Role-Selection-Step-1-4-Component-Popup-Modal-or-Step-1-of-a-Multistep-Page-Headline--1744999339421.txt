PHASE 1: Role Selection (Step 1/4)
📍 Component: Popup Modal or Step 1 of a Multistep Page
Headline: “Who are you?”

Subhead: “Choose the role(s) that describe how you’ll use PropertyDeals”

User can select one or more roles:


Role	Subtitle	Tooltip / Context
Buyer	Buy properties from verified sellers	Investors, landlords, flippers
Seller	Sell properties directly to buyers	Homeowners, wholesalers, agents
REP	List services, post deals, connect	Agents, contractors, lenders, appraisers
💡 Design Notes:
Style like /signin tag carousel: rotating top label:

text
Copy
Edit
Made for Buyers → Made for Sellers → Made for REPs
Cycle every 5 seconds unless user clicks

Role cards should animate on hover/tap and show clear selection states

✅ Once roles selected → CTA: “Continue”

🧱 PHASE 2: Email Entry + Verification (Step 2/4)
🎯 Two options:
Manual Email Signup

Enter email → click “Continue”

Send 6-digit verification code to email

User enters code → progresses

Social Sign-In

Google / Apple / Facebook buttons

If used, skip to Phase 3

UX Notes:
Email field has autocomplete="email"

Progress bar at top: Step 2 of 4

Show subtext: “We’ll use this email to keep your account secure”

If user uses Google or Apple, don’t show email field — just auto-capture and proceed

🧱 PHASE 3: Create Password (Step 3/4)
Only show if user signed up manually

Input field + confirm password

Option to reveal password

Button: “Secure My Account”

UI Enhancements:
Add “You’re almost there!” message above the fields

Keep consistent CTA placement + animations for continuity

🧱 PHASE 4: Phone Verification (Step 4/4)
Ask for phone number (input w/ country code dropdown)

“We’ll text you a code to confirm your number”

Input 6-digit SMS code

Button: “Verify and Continue”

This is the final step before access is granted

✅ FINAL STEP: Welcome + Get Started (After Verification)
Show a branded success modal or full-screen confirmation:

🎉 Welcome to PropertyDeals!
“Your account is ready. You’re now part of the network.”

CTA Button: “Start Exploring”

Secondary: “Build Your Profile” → links to /onboarding

🎯 Design Notes:
Add confetti emoji 🎊 or celebration animation

Keep color palette matched to user role selected

🔁 Onboarding (Optional/Deferred)
After entering the platform, guide users with a modal or page asking:

Profile Photo

Location

Bio

Deal Interests / Service Tags

Link social accounts

This is optional but encouraged, and should feel like an opportunity, not a barrier.
