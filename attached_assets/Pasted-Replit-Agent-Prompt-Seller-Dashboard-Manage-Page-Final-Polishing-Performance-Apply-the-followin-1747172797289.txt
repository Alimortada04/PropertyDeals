Replit Agent Prompt: Seller Dashboard – Manage Page Final Polishing & Performance
Apply the following refinements to the Seller Dashboard Manage Page (/sellerdash/[userId]/manage) to fully align it with the Buyer Dashboard’s styling, load speed, and professional-grade experience:

🧠 Tooltip Behavior
Fix all tooltip positioning so they are not restricted by the card boundaries.

Tooltips must be able to overflow the card if necessary.

Apply to:

Priority badges (e.g., High/Medium/Low)

New Offer / New Message status tags

Document icons

Any truncated property text

Use z-index, overflow: visible, and position: absolute on parents as needed.

🎨 Property Card Design Updates
✅ Remove the “bed / bath / sqft” tags — they are no longer needed.

✅ Refactor the price section:

Listing Price → black rounded pill

Assignment Profit → green rounded pill

Highest Offer (if available) → blue pill with hover tooltip

Purchase Price → remove completely

✅ Tooltip on Highest Offer should say:
“Highest offer received today from [Buyer Name]. Click to view in Roadmap.”

✅ Highest Offer pill should link directly to the Offers tab in Property Roadmap (/sellerdash/[userId]/property/[propertyId]#offers)

Ensure visual spacing under the image and title remains clean and uncluttered.

🧩 Column Layout Improvements
✅ Increase the width of each Kanban column to better fit full-size property cards, buttons, and content without feeling cramped.

✅ Keep independent vertical scrolling for each column.

✅ Maintain clean horizontal scrolling across the whole board on smaller screens.

🚫 Status Badge Behavior Fix
Fix the hover state on status badges like New Offer, New Message, Priority Tags — they should not change color or style on hover.

Maintain consistent visual weight and behavior across all interaction states.

⚡ Performance Optimization
Improve route performance so switching between Seller Dashboard pages (/home, /manage, /engagement, /analytics) is instant with no loading delay.

Match the transition behavior and load speed of the Buyer Dashboard:

Use layout caching, preloading logic, or route transitions

Ensure no unnecessary reloads or flickers
