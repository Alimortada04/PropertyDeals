✅ Part 1: /signin Page (Login)
🔹 Purpose:
Allow users to log in with speed, security, and simplicity using modern methods.

🔧 Features to Implement:
Google Sign In

Apple Sign In

Biometric Login (Face ID / Touch ID if supported via WebAuthn)

Show biometric login option only if the browser and device support it

Use navigator.credentials.get() with WebAuthn to auto-login trusted devices

Divider: OR continue with email

Email + Password fields

“Remember Me” toggle (default ON)

Forgot password link

Submit button: Sign In

Tiny footer:

“Don’t have an account? [Create one]”

💡 Design Notes:
Split layout:

Left = logo + tagline or rotating benefits

Right = login form

Clean, minimalistic — match PropertyDeals branding

✅ Part 2: /register Page (Sign Up)
🔹 Purpose:
Allow users to register quickly while selecting their user type (Buyer, Seller, REP), and defer full profile setup to a guided onboarding experience.

🔧 Step 1: Role Selection
Create a role selector at the top of the page with 3 clickable cards:

Roles:
Buyer

"Buy properties from trusted local sellers"

Seller

"Sell your property to verified investors"

REP

"List, market, and close deals faster"

Selected role determines the registration form below.

🔧 Step 2: Role-Based Registration Form
Google Sign Up

Apple Sign Up

Optional: Enable Biometric Login toggle

Email + Password (confirm password)

Dynamic fields by role:

Buyer: Name, City, Investment Goals (optional)

Seller: Name, Property Location, Preferred Sale Method

REP: Name, REP Type (Agent, Contractor, Lender, etc.), Company, Years Experience

Save selected role to user metadata during registration.

🔁 After Successful Registration:
Redirect to /onboarding (or /profile/setup) for guided profile setup.

✅ Part 3: Optional /onboarding Page (Post-Signup Profile Builder)
After signing up, users are taken to a separate guided flow to complete their profile.

Sections to build:
Upload avatar + banner

Add bio, location, specialties

Add social links (LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram)

Toggle visibility settings (public profile, contact methods)

Notification preferences

Confirm role and add extra details

⚙️ Technical Notes
Use modern session handling:

Store long-lived refresh tokens

Trust devices to prevent repeated logins

Use WebAuthn for biometric login:

Setup: navigator.credentials.create()

Auth: navigator.credentials.get()

Use Supabase or other auth platform’s metadata field to store user role
