1. Relocate Action Buttons
Move the existing buttons:

Contact Seller

Make an Offer

Save

Share

To this new location:

Replace the current property tag section (where “Single Family,” “Light Rehab,” and “5 days on PropertyDeals” are shown).

Completely remove those tag elements from the page.

Make sure spacing and alignment of the new button area looks clean and balanced under the property address and price.

✅ 2. Clean Up Spacing Above Nav Menu
Reduce or eliminate the vertical spacing above the section navigation (Numbers, Location, REPs, etc.).

Ensure this nav bar appears visually connected to the property content above it.

✅ 3. Fix Sticky Header Scroll Offset
When clicking the nav menu (e.g., "Numbers", "Location"), the scroll should:

Not cover the section heading with the sticky nav bar.

Implement a scroll offset:

js
Copy
Edit
const scrollWithOffset = (elId) => {
  const el = document.getElementById(elId);
  const yOffset = -64; // Adjust based on exact navbar height
  const y = el.getBoundingClientRect().top + window.scrollY + yOffset;
  window.scrollTo({ top: y, behavior: 'smooth' });
};
Replace regular anchor behavior with this scroll function on click.

✅ 4. PD Rating Tooltip
Next to the PD Rating (e.g. “PD Rating: 7/10”), add a small (i) icon.

On hover, show a tooltip that says:

PD Rating Explanation
This score is based on repair costs, location, pricing vs comps, and projected rental income.

Use a tooltip/popup styled component already used on the site (or lightweight new one if needed).

✅ 5. Redesign Calculators Under “The Numbers” Section
Instead of showing both full calculators by default:

Remove the current “Flip Calculator” and “Rental Calculator” cards.

Inside the "The Numbers" section, add two buttons:

Calculate Flip Profit

Calculate Rental Returns

When either is clicked:

Reveal an inline calculator section below the buttons.

Pre-fill with available values (purchase price, repair cost, ARV, rent, expenses, etc.).

Allow users to edit those values freely.

Show calculated outputs (e.g. “Estimated Profit: $X”, “Cap Rate: Y%”).

Include a button: Reset to Default to restore original data.

Keep the interaction smooth:

Don’t use modals.

Use collapsible/accordion or inline reveal patterns.

Ensure all updates are responsive and maintain consistent styling with the rest of the page.
