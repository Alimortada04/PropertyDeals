We're focusing solely on the Hero Section of the homepage for PropertyDeals.

🎯 Objective:
Create a modern, emotionally resonant, and visually striking hero section that instantly communicates the value of PropertyDeals as a real estate platform built for:

Investors & Buyers (looking for off-market deals)

REPs (Real Estate Professionals like contractors, agents, lenders)

Sellers & Wholesalers (looking to move properties quickly)

This hero needs to feel trustworthy, cutting-edge, and community-driven. Think bold typography, modern visuals, and subtle animations or scroll interactions to elevate the experience.

🧩 Requirements:
1. Design
Full-width hero section with modern layout (split layout or layered layout encouraged)

Background: subtle gradient, pattern, or parallax movement is encouraged

Fonts: Use League Spartan for headings (semi-bold), and Lato for body text

Colors: Use brand palette (Primary Green #09261E, Accent Salmon #E59F9F, Wine #803344, Light Green #135341, etc.)

Keep everything clean, readable, and visually structured

2. Content
Headline (H1): Emphasize action + opportunity
Example:

“Built on Trust, Powered by Real Estate”

Subtext: A short one-liner to support the vision:

“Discover off-market opportunities, connect with trusted professionals, and grow your real estate network.”

CTAs (Call to Actions):

“Explore Deals” (Primary — link to /properties)

“Join our Community” (Secondary — link to /reps or /register)

3. Visuals
Include a graphic, hero image, or modern real estate-themed illustration on the right side (or background layer)

Responsive design (mobile-first behavior)

Optional but encouraged:  scroll animation or hover effect to bring it to life (I want the hero to pop out at you)

🔧 Notes:
Remove the current property search bar from the homepage entirely — it should not be shown in this hero section.

This section should set the emotional tone for the rest of the homepage. Think of it as the first impression for visitors — it needs to communicate value, vision, and community in one glance.

Keep the layout modular so we can build sections below it without design clash.
