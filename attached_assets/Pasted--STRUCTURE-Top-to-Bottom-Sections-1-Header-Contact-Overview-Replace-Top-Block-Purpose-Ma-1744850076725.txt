🧠 UX / PSYCHOLOGICAL NOTES
Top → bottom should flow from trust signals → proof of experience → social validation → contact CTA

Use subtle animation (e.g. fade or slide on section load)

Use whitespace to separate sections

Use iconography for clarity (location pin, message bubble, stars, etc.)

✅ TECH REQUIREMENTS
Responsive across all screen sizes

Use existing Supabase data where applicable

Show fallback/placeholder if any field is missing (e.g. default avatar or “No reviews yet”)

Use Tailwind for all styling (match PropertyDeals brand)
