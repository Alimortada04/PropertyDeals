💡 Vision & Brand Vibe:
PropertyDeals is building a modern platform for discovering exclusive off-market properties and connecting with trusted professionals (REPs). The site should feel:

Bold, high-conversion, and startup-grade

Community-focused

Polished and investor-savvy

Creative and movement-oriented (scrolling = an experience)

🎯 Key Home Page Features to Include:
Hero Section
Animated or parallax background

Bold headline + subheadline (e.g. “Off-Market Deals. Real Connections.”)

CTA buttons: “Browse Properties” and “Explore REPs”

Smooth entry animations

Feature Highlights (2-3 Horizontal Sections)
Horizontal sections for each of the core use cases:

“Find off-market deals others can’t see”

“Connect with real estate pros in your area”

“Track, favorite, and analyze your deals”

Use subtle scroll animations or fade-in effects.

Embedded Property Cards (Dynamic)
Showcase top-performing property cards (from our listings)

Interactive hover effects: show image slides or microanimations

Click = navigate to property detail

Community & REP Section
Highlight “The REP Room” and allow users to browse or join.

Include verified avatars, mini bios, or location highlights

Optionally include a floating interactive map background that shifts as user scrolls

Testimonials / Trust Section
Use creative grid layout (inspired by Jeton, Adobe, or Slite)

Include 3 short testimonials or community quotes

Minimal design with parallax or slide-in transitions

Sticky or Floating Elements
Floating sticky button (e.g. “Join Now” or “Chat With Us”)

Scroll indicator on the left or right (dot-based like https://plunderandpoach.webflow.io/)

Footer Section
Minimal but branded

Include links to: About, Help, Terms, Cookies, Socials, etc.

📱 Responsiveness & Interaction
Make the experience seamless on desktop, tablet, and mobile

Enable scroll-triggered interactions (scrolling over sections activates transitions)

Use Framer Motion, GSAP, or CSS animations for parallax, fade, zoom, and slide-in effects

🛠️ Technical Notes
Framework: Next.js 14 (App Router)
